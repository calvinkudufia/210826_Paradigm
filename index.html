                    The landscape that fostered postmodern cultural creation is in flames. If we are able to evolve, this fire will raze a forest whose dead roots cling to a dead system, and from its ashes will rise a new creative paradigm. If we refuse, we will be left speaking a dead language, to no one, in the dark.
                    The internet has ushered in a new age, a faster digital reality that speaks to more people more loudly. For tech and startups, it’s easy, the language of this world is their own. But traditional players of cultural production like fashion remain wary of adapting to the change that digital natives embody.
                    First steps were taken: Tapping into non-seasonal cycles, and drop models, digital advertising and more diverse modes of content creation. The systems of power, for the most part, however, have stayed intact. We worked on our infrastructure and our distribution, but one part remained untouched. We didn’t change the way we think about ourselves. A new fluency is necessary; we must convert or be condemned. Adapt or die.

                        The Internet is the new real-time. Reality is happening here; all the time, everywhere, at lightning speed, source unknown. Subcultures formerly residing in the streets can now be found in Reddit threads and private chats. Streetwear will soon be replaced by Internetwear. The analog interprets the digital in slow motion → From setting the agenda to interpreting the agenda. Humans, unable to cope with the speed at which information is presented, burn out. Analog magazines that don’t shift gears shut down. Maybe you should just be a newsletter!

                    <div class="text">
	                    The battle between being accessible, woke, and believing in a better world vs. creating desire through exclusivity, gate-keeping, and making money, is reaching primetime. This tension reflects our internal, individual struggle of being fluid – stylists, creative directors, DJs all at once – and the commercial drive to act territorial about our identity. The success of the individual genius is outdated. Time to examine how to make non-territorial wokeness profitable.

                        THE DEATH OF THE <br>
                        COLLABORATION<br><br>
                        When Balenciaga x Gucci doesn’t raise eyebrows, you know that collaborations are over. Two entities would meet to slap logos on each other. The collaboration seemingly ended with its announcement. Hot air printed on a Gilden hoodie. All PR, little substance. In the age of fluidity, stacking identities feels entirely retro. We’ve entered the endgame of postmodernism, where there are no longer any opposites, and merging identities is normal, if not to say expected.

                        Start-up lingo slaughtered lux brand communications with slogans screaming, “look how accessible this is.” Forcing function via messages of goodness, proclaimed authenticity, and the commodification of our quirks. Patronizing a woke consumer with subway ads like “Saving money with honey feels like when you notice a typo on a poster and are super proud of yourself.” Wake up, honey, you’re not a VC bro!

                        Trump and a global pandemic lifted the veil on our romantic little idea of authenticity in an inherently mediated world. The opposite of authentic, the escape from what’s real - fake furs, life on Instagram, VR - proved to be better than authentic. We enter Meaning-Mode. Presented with 10x versions of the truth, we choose what we want to believe. “Does this fit into my version of self?” Regardless of real or fake. Your shopping cart signals personal values and affiliation with communities. Are brands the equivalent of band T-shirts now?

                        Fashion stole from everything and everyone. Now everyone is stealing from fashion. Fashion as an industry became more about marketing and less about the craft. When Ferrari can drop a clothing line, we have to wonder: What does it mean to be a fashion brand today? Will designers drop in and out of mattress brands, Ikea and Toyota? Is Toyota the new Balenciaga? What do we have left to defend the fortress?
